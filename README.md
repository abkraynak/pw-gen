## Introduction
This project is a short program that generates a unique, random, and secure password of a desired length, which is
displayed on the terminal. 
***
## Purpose
I started this project to learn and practice the Go language while also making a useful utility.
This program will generate a unique string to use as a secure password. The length of the desired password is
given, and the program will display the password.
***
## Usage and Examples
Run the Go file and enter the length of the password you want to generate. 
The result will be displayed on the terminal.

Random Password Generator
Enter desired password length : 25
Your random password is : Ojp.e+;#C>;%l+6]X(J?8Hv4
````

## Future Improvements
I would like to extend this program to include more ways to customize the generated password, such as setting
a number of uppercase letters needed or to exclude some of the special charectors, to better adapt it to 
user's needs.
Another feature that could make the program more useful would be a way to store generated passwords to reference
